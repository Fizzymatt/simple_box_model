# What is this?

A simple HTML 5 page to demonstrate CSS styling

# Instructions

1. Clone the repository into a location of your choice
2. Navigate to the project root
3. Open the index.html file in a web browser
4. Open the code in an editor, and have a play around with the CSS styles (i.e. css/index.css) to see how it affects the page layout

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- this has only been tested in Firefox, Brave and Chrome browsers. It'll _probably_ work in others, so long as they're reasonably modern, but I haven't checked
- I've created the styles with simplicity in mind, and there are more efficient ways to achieve the same thing
- I'm by no means a front-end expert, so do your own research around this stuff too :)
